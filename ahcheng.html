            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Ah Cheng is a major character and Stanley's best friend on the ship in Janice Wee's novel <a href="https://books2read.com/u/mV0WoM">Singapore's Runaway</a>. Born in Singapore to Hokkien immigrant parents from China, the youth is the first generation of his family to be born in the city-state. He is a self-taught street fighter who has created his own form of martial arts and is a formidable fighter.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Despite his martial arts prowess, Ah Cheng quietly accepts regular beatings from Arnott Merritt and the White Trio, fearing that fighting back would cost him his job during the British Colonial days. His family in Singapore depends on the money he sends back, as he has a sick mother to support.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Things take a turn when pirates board the ship at night. Ah Cheng uses his martial arts skills to protect Arnott from a fatal blow by the pirates. The two then fight back to back, helping their shipmates drive off the attackers. This incident leads to a change of heart in Arnott, who is moved by Ah Cheng's forgiveness.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Character Development: Throughout his adventures, Ah Cheng's motivations and goals stem from his deep sense of family responsibility. He strives to earn enough money to provide his mother with the medical treatment she needs. As a character, Ah Cheng embodies resilience, loyalty, and the power of forgiveness.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Ooph. Heeaah.&rdquo;<br><br>
Grunts came from behind a pillar on the deck.<br><br>
A sliver of light revealed a small, sinewy Chinese man&rsquo;s practiced kicks and punches. The style was unfamiliar. At a glance, this was how untrained street brawlers fought. Yet the more he observed, the more these moves looked like unique blend of various fighting styles, more powerful, more complex than an ordinary brawler's.<br><br>
The practitioner was too engrossed to notice his audience.<br><br>

A sliver of light revealed a small, sinewy Chinese man's practiced kicks and punches. The style was unfamiliar. At a glance, this was how untrained street brawlers fought. Yet the more he observed, the more these moves looked like unique blend of various fighting styles, more powerful, more complex than an ordinary brawler's.<br><br>
Is that Kung Fu?&rdquo; Stanley asked. <br><br>
&ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo; Ah Cheng was a deer caught in headlights. He froze, his leg like a cartoon character&rsquo;s, sticking out with his foot at chest level. His arm, extended with his clenched fist forward, as if punching an invisible opponent in front of him and kicking another to his right.<br><br>
For a full minute, Ah Cheng held that pose, mouth wide open, staring at Stanley.<br><br>
His balance, phenomenal.<br><br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell. Secret,&rdquo; Ah Cheng mumbled, lowering his foot to the ground.
