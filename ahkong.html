            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Ah Kong</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600"><I>Tammy's Grandpa</I></p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Ah Kong is Tammy's adored grandfather, a man who repeatedly advises his granddaughter, "God gave you a brain. He expects you to use it." He tries his best to instill attentiveness in Tammy, jestingly remarking that if her head weren't firmly attached to her body, she'd likely misplace it too.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Ah Kong dotes on each of his grandchildren, ensuring he has something special reserved for each one. For Tammy, it's the custard apples from his tree, saved exclusively for her. His interactions with Tammy are full of playful teasing and good-natured humor, always coupled with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Ah Kong embodies generosity and strength. Despite his advancing age, he is often seen lugging around a heavy pail full of water as he goes about his daily chores. His kind-hearted nature and strength are equally matched by his culinary skills, developed from his days working with chefs under British governance during the colonial era.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">His green thumb is evident in the thriving fruit trees in his garden, producing sweet papayas and custard apples, and rose bushes that are perpetually in bloom. Cut roses are kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and displayed prominently when visitors arrive. </p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">As a proud Straits Born Chinese, he often wears a white singlet and grey shorts. His favorite dish is ayam buah keluak, a testament to his rich heritage. </p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Tammy tilted her head, curiosity piqued.<br><br>
&ldquo;If you eat only one fisheye, a third eye will appear on your forehead the next morning,&rdquo; Ah Kong said, his expression dead serious.<br><br>
Tammy gulped. She felt her forehead. Then she looked at Ah Kong. He schooled his expression, but his playful eyes gave him away.<br><br>
&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want to eat both. I just want one,&rdquo; She reached out for a chicken wing and nibbled the crispy, delectable skin.<br><br>
&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; Ah Kong helped himself to more squid. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if you wake up with a new eye in the middle of your forehead,&rdquo; he smirked.<br><br>
Tammy&rsquo;s not going to fall for Ah Kong&rsquo;s tricks. She ignored him and reached for the plate of watermelon. Thoughts about a third eye made it tricky to eat the seedy fruit. As her mind drifted, a watermelon seed slid down her throat.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ah Kong, what happens when you swallow a seed?&rdquo; Tammy feigned nonchalance.<br><br>
"Oh, the seed sprouts into a magnificent tree atop your head," he replied, unperturbed. "Why?" <br><br>
&ldquo;I swallowed a seed,&rdquo; Tammy&rsquo;s stomach turned.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ah, then you&rsquo;ll have a never-ending supply of watermelons. All you do is to pluck them from the tree sprouting from your head,&rdquo; Ah Kong struggled to contain his laughter.
