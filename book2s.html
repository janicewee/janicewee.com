             During British rule, Singapore became a major hub for the opium trade, with the British East India Company monopolizing the industry. Opium, a highly profitable commodity, fueled the city-state's economy but also led to addiction, health issues, and social problems. The trade attracted a diverse clientele and spawned opium dens across Singapore.<br><br>
Over time, international pressure and anti-opium movements arose, prompting efforts to regulate and eventually eradicate the trade. The opium trade's impact left a lasting imprint on Singapore's history, shaping its society and policies.<br><br> In <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b5qeMR">Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer</a>, this is where George begins his investigation into a murder linked to an Opium Syndicate.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
During Dutch rule, Ternate, an island in the Maluku archipelago of Indonesia, was an important stronghold for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The Dutch sought to control the lucrative spice trade, particularly cloves, which were abundant in Ternate. They established a fortified presence on the island, building forts and establishing trade monopolies.<br><Br>
Ternate became a center for spice cultivation and export under Dutch rule, with the local population subjected to Dutch governance and taxation. The Dutch influence extended to various aspects of Ternate's society, economy, and administration. Today, remnants of the Dutch colonial era, such as historic buildings and cultural influences, can still be observed in Ternate, reflecting the lasting impact of Dutch rule on the island.. <br><br>
