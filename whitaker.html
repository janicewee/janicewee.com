            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Major Edward Whitaker, the lone beacon of the Whitaker legacy in Singapore, owes his survival to the brave and compassionate Rupert, his parents' butler-turned-father figure. Traumatized by the brutal massacre of his family by the ruthless Sanhehu opium syndicate, Edward became a stern yet benevolent figurehead, embracing Rupert's lessons of generosity and compassion. This inclusive ethos extended to the orphaned Ah Gong, nurtured and loved within the Whitaker household. Edward's paradoxical existence-head of a ruthless syndicate yet a caring man-is the adhesive binding his loyal household together, making them not just servants, but family.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">The sole surviving grandchild of Cary and Grace Whitaker, Edward Whitaker bore witness to the horrifying massacre of his family by the hands of rival opium syndicate, <a href="indo.htm">Sanhehu</a>. Hiding from the brutal onslaught, Edward survived, only to be found by Rupert, his parents' butler. Rupert raised Edward as his own, instilling in him the values of generosity and compassion for those he considered family.<br><br>
With the inheritance of the family business from his abroad-living uncle, Edward found himself at the helm of the Singapore branch of the opium syndicate. Guided by his uncle, Edward ensured the operations remained within the law, making them immune to criminal charges. But behind the wealth and power, Edward's heart harbored an unquenchable thirst for revenge.<br><br>
Yet, his life was not all dark. In his household, a host of characters added color to Edward's existence. His butler, Rupert, was like a father to him, providing advice and support. Gong Kia, the lively servant boy, brought joy and laughter. Ahmad, the bodyguard and chef, provided security and delicious meals. Madam Chan, the oldest servant, was a motherly figure who knew all the family secrets. And Kavi Ananta, the snake charmer and contract killer, was Edward's lethal tool against his enemies.

<blockquote> 
Five year old Edward, a light sleeper snapped awake. Orange flames from moving torches lit the chaos outside his bedroom window. <br><br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re under attack!&rdquo; Grandpa&rsquo;s voice called out from the next room. The door crashed open. Edward slid under his bed. The metallic smell of blood and death wafted into his bedroom.<br><br>
His little heart pounded as he tried to imagine what was going on outside.<br><br>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He heard his father cry. His mother screamed. He heard his father&rsquo;s blows and screams. Two thuds. Falling bodies. His parents?<br><br>
He couldn&rsquo;t see. The flickering torches didn&rsquo;t give much light. Terror gripped him. Is that daddy and mummy on the floor, covered with blood? Why aren&rsquo;t they moving?<br><br>
A big man dressed in black, carrying a massive sword walked over their bodies. He walked around the room, poking into the curtains with his swords. &ldquo;Come out. I know you&rsquo;re hiding in there.&rdquo;<br><br>
Be brave. Be calm. Hide, then run.<br><br>
Uncle Rupert taught him that when he was three.

<blockquote> 
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of those anti-opium Chinese activists.&rdquo; Pointing a gun at George, the blonde man spat his words.<br><br>
Though he was not a religious man, George shot a quick prayer to God. <br><br>
&ldquo;Put that gun down or <I>you</I> will kneel and scrub the carpet until every blood stain is removed,&rdquo; a powerful voice resonated through the room.<br><br>
<I>Rupert!</I> <br><br>
&ldquo;Ah Niu, return to your station in the kitchen now.&rdquo; The spry, elderly man spared George a glance before glaring down his assailants.<br><br>
&ldquo;Rupert, he&rsquo;s one of them,&rdquo; the blonde protested.<br><br>
&ldquo;One of whom?&rdquo; Rupert snorted. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even tell my men apart. To you, we Chinese all look alike.&rdquo; <br><br>He turned on his heel and ushered George through the kitchen into one of the rooms used for food storage.

Gong Kia was the first at the table. <br><br>
He was on the table to be exact. The little monkey sat atop the large teak table, untying the strings that secured the hamper&rsquo;s lid. &ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s friends give the best treats!&rdquo; The twelve-year-old exclaimed.<br><br>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he want this for himself?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s generosity shocked George. <br><br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty more from where that came from. He&rsquo;s keeping the rest for his immediate family,&rdquo; Rupert ruffled George&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Employees are his extended family.&rdquo;<br><br>
Ahmad walked out of the kitchen, a large iron pot of tea in one hand, a large coffee pot in the other. &ldquo;Pastries, biscuits and deep-fried snacks are best with the coffee or tea.&rdquo; The big, jolly man set the pots beside basket.<br><br>
George plucked Gong Kia off the table and plopped the boy on the stool beside him. <br><br>
&ldquo;Mmpphhh!&rdquo; little piglet&rsquo;s biscuit-filled cheeks looked like balloons that were about to burst.
