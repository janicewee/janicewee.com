            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Cassie</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Eight-year-old Cassie is a spirited tomboy, brimming with creativity and cleverness. Her agility rivals that of a gymnast; she can scale walls, climb trees, and practically anything else.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Fearless and warm-hearted, Cassie stands up to bullies, thugs, and criminals using her wit and acrobatic prowess. She has a unique bond with animals, and they reciprocate her affection. Her empathetic nature allows her to understand people and animals alike, always striving to protect. In the book, she embarks on a shared adventure with a squirrel she named Squeaky.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Cassie's athleticism is as impressive as her courage. An excellent swimmer, a swift runner, and extremely flexible, her petite stature belies her physical abilities. </p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Her mischievous streak, combined with Tammy's, often leaves the adults at their wits' end. Cassie possesses a strong independent streak, an infectious laugh, and a keen sense of humor that adds to her vivacious personality.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Cassie's love for comic books has made her a walking encyclopedia of comic lore. Her favorite toys are her light saber and a well-loved teddy bear. She has a fondness for mee siam and has a penchant for the color purple.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">In her short stories, Cassie proves her bravery numerous times - rescuing Tammy from kidnappers, scaring away burglars, and even solving a murder case overlooked by the police, bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<blockquote>The brick wall had to be even taller than Ah Kong. No way her brothers could climb that, but Cassie was confident she could.
<br><br>
Shedding her shoes, the little girl found her foothold between bricks. Scaling the wall like a little monkey, she perched on top of the wall overlooking the compound. <br><br>
Stuffed gunny sacks and wooden crates littered the concrete floor. The overpowering stench of smelly socks wafted up her nostrils. Crinkling her nose, she scanned the compound for her little cousin.
Little red shoes kicked from behind a wooden crate. <br><br>
Tam.<br><br>
Cassie looked down at the concrete floor directly below. It was a long drop with nothing to break her fall.<br><br>
She&rsquo;ll break her own fall. <br><br>
The little gymnast leaped, somersaulting once, twice, thrice, landing on her feet like a cat.
