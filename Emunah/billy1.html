<h3 class="mt-4">Prologue: Leonard (Warning. Graphic content.)
</h3><br>
<p class="lead">

For involuntary manslaughter, Jayden sentenced me to a lifetime of community service - as Billy’s babysitter.<br><br>

The indignity of it all. <br>
Someone as majestic as me — reduced to playing nanny to an itty bitty little orphan boy.
<br><br>
It’s not my fault. I did all I could to save that silly man’s life.<br>
I tried to pull his head out of my mouth but the stubborn guy refused to budge, determined to impress his little kid.
<br><br>
I have paws.<br>
I can’t grip onto things like humans do.<br>
And I have an allergy to dust or whatever it was that got into my nose.<br><br>

I sneezed.<br><br>

My jaws snapped shut.<br>
I couldn’t help it.
<br><br>
The office door creaked open.<br><br>

“Leonard, you may come in now,” a low female voice announced.<br><br>

That’s my therapist, Ava.<br>
Yeah, I have been seeing her thrice a week since then. <br>
King’s orders.<br><br>

It’s to help me deal with the trauma of *shudder* - the unspeakable horror of the incident.
That, and the stress of babysitting that hyperactive, wild boy.<br><br>

I know. <br>
I’m rambling.<br><br>

“Leonard, it’s your turn now,” she chimed.<br><br>

Sorry about my lack of manners.<br>
I forgot to introduce myself.<br>
I’m Leonard.<br>
A lion.<br>
Single, available, bachelor who is open to meeting the lioness of...<br>
<br>
“Leonard!” <br><br>

A woman with long red hair stormed out of the office, and shoved the massive lion into her office. 
<br><br>
Ava’s very strong for a mortal. <br><br>

Did you know she was engaged to King Jayden before he was murdered for his Faith in the Lamb of God. He was given a new immortal body and now reigns with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
<br><br>
“Who are you talking to?” Ava tilted her head, her long red hair falling over her eyes. <br>
She would have made a gorgeous lioness. No wonder Jayden fell for her.<br><br>

He can’t be her mate now.<br><br>

“Who can’t be whose mate?” Ava asked.<br><br>

“Nothing. No one,” replied the lion.<br><br>

Can’t talk to you anymore or she’d think I’m nuts.<br><br>

Ciao.<br>
<br><br>
