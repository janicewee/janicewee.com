<h3 class="mt-4">Overview</h3> 
<p class="lead">
The story follows Billy, a mortal orphan whose parents died but were later resurrected as immortals. Raised by human minders Mei, Boris, Ava, and Leo after his parents’ death, Billy is also cared for by Leonard, a lion sentenced by the immortal King Jayden to be his nanny as punishment for accidentally killing a man. Leonard communicates with Billy, other animals, and humans across languages by using a translator glove invented by the resident scientist, Leo.
<br><br>
Yearning to reunite with his resurrected parents, Billy runs away to find the Celestial City, where he believes they reside. Leonard, has no choice, but follow his parole obligation. Their journey takes an unexpected turn when they get lost and end up in Kangaroo Land, a lush paradise teeming with animals and abundant food. There, Leonard meets and falls in love with a lioness named Lina. The two lions grow fond of the itty bitty little boy and adopt Billy as their human cub. They later have twin cubs, Mike and Mitch. Billy grows up alongside his lion brothers, developing animal-like mannerisms, physical strength, and the ability to converse with animals. The lions in this world are notably vegan, with a serious obsession with hay, and Billy becomes skilled at hay-making, much to Leonard’s delight.
<br><br>
Eventually, the lion family reaches the Celestial City, a radiant, futuristic utopia filled with towering buildings, fertile lands, and a river running through it. This is a place of peace and magnificence. However, Billy’s parents, Jake and Ella, have already left by the time he arrives. Later, they are found in Lydia’s kingdom, a human realm adjacent to Lydia’s garden—a wildlife reserve abundant with food for its animal inhabitants. While the lions settle in the garden, Billy spends a year with his parents in the Celestial City, learning about his heritage. The story hints at a divide between mortals and immortals, suggesting Billy’s path may diverge from his parents’ immortal destiny.
<br><br>
The book blends themes of family, identity, and adventure, set against a fantastical backdrop of talking animals, immortals with superpowers, and paradisiacal lands. Billy’s journey is both a literal and emotional quest to find his place in a world where mortals and immortals, humans and animals, intersect.

<h3 class="mt-4">Prologue: Leonard (Warning. Graphic content.)
</h3><br>
<p class="lead">

For involuntary manslaughter, Jayden sentenced me to a lifetime of community service - as Billy’s babysitter.<br><br>

The indignity of it all. <br>
Someone as majestic as me — reduced to playing nanny to an itty bitty little orphan boy.
<br><br>
It’s not my fault. I did all I could to save that silly man’s life.<br>
I tried to pull his head out of my mouth but the stubborn guy refused to budge, determined to impress his little kid.
<br><br>
I have paws.<br>
I can’t grip onto things like humans do.<br>
And I have an allergy to dust or whatever it was that got into my nose.<br><br>

I sneezed.<br><br>

My jaws snapped shut.<br>
I couldn’t help it.
<br><br>
The office door creaked open.<br><br>

“Leonard, you may come in now,” a low female voice announced.<br><br>

That’s my therapist, Ava.<br>
Yeah, I have been seeing her thrice a week since then. <br>
King’s orders.<br><br>

It’s to help me deal with the trauma of *shudder* - the unspeakable horror of the incident.
That, and the stress of babysitting that hyperactive, wild boy.<br><br>

I know. <br>
I’m rambling.<br><br>

“Leonard, it’s your turn now,” she chimed.<br><br>

Sorry about my lack of manners.<br>
I forgot to introduce myself.<br>
I’m Leonard.<br>
A lion.<br>
Single, available, bachelor who is open to meeting the lioness of...<br>
<br>
“Leonard!” <br><br>

A woman with long red hair stormed out of the office, and shoved the massive lion into her office. 
<br><br>
Ava’s very strong for a mortal. <br><br>

Did you know she was engaged to King Jayden before he was murdered for his Faith in the Lamb of God. He was given a new immortal body and now reigns with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
<br><br>
“Who are you talking to?” Ava tilted her head, her long red hair falling over her eyes. <br>
She would have made a gorgeous lioness. No wonder Jayden fell for her.<br><br>

He can’t be her mate now.<br><br>

“Who can’t be whose mate?” Ava asked.<br><br>

“Nothing. No one,” replied the lion.<br><br>

Can’t talk to you anymore or she’d think I’m nuts.<br><br>

Ciao.<br>
