<h3 class="mt-4">Excerpt</h3><br>
<p class="lead">
It’s a tragedy when we fail to realise that what we longed for, has been with us all along...<br>
Until it’s too late. <br>
Such is the story of Abigail Applewood.<br><br><br>


Beep – beep – beep.<br>
The sky’s still dark. <br>
Without sparing the culprit a glance, Abigail reached for the snooze button, accidentally knocking the alarm clock off its perch. The poor thing gave up its ghost.<br><br>
“Ugh.” <br>
She forced her leaden body out of her soft, warm bed and checked the broken clock.<br>
8:15<br>
She’d be late.<br>
Her new boss would kill her!<br><br>
Drowsiness fled.<br>
No time to shower. Toothbrush in foamy mouth, she grabbed the first dress from her wardrobe, slipped into it, rinsed her mouth and ran for the bus, high heel shoes in one hand, her handbag in the other.<br>
The merciful driver waited for her.<br><br>
“Thanks,” she mumbled as she boarded the bus, her eyes searching for an empty seat.<br>
Plopping herself beside a man with his nose stuck in his tablet, she sighed. Relief washed over her. She wouldn’t be late. She slipped on her shoes, conjured a pack of crackers from her bag and nibbled as her ride brought her to the bus stop a street away from the office building.<br><br> 
Lightning flashed across the gloomy sky.<br>
Thunder cracked.<br>
The heavens opened with a sudden onslaught of rain.<br>
Searching through her bag, her heart sank. Her umbrella was missing. <br>
How then?<br>
Should she brave the rain and show up looking like a wet cat?<br>
It was either that or get fired for reporting late again. <br><br>
Stepping into the rain, she remained remarkably dry. The sensual scent of wood and musk engulfed her. Heart racing, she stopped, bumping into a hard muscled chest beneath a thin layer of fabric.<br>
Looking up, mesmerising eyes framed by thick fringes of lashes met hers. A drop dead gorgeous guy, built like a professional football player, sheltered her with a large black umbrella.
