<h3 class="mt-4">Prologue</h3><br>
<p class="lead">
Do beings from another reality exist?<br><br>
What if someone, or something from another dimension is monitoring mankind?<br><br>
What if that superior lifeform intends to direct the course of humanity towards its own agenda?<br><br>
That’s what my UFO obsessed buddy, Emma, proclaims. These aliens are the good guys who want to stop us from destroying the earth.<br><br>
Leo, my flat mate, insists the Big Bang created the universe and Higgs boson proves it.<br><br>
As for me?<br><br>
I believe what my dad told me. That God created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh, even though my pals think I’m crazy. <br><br>
Jayden has his theories too. <br><br>
Speaking of Jayden, he is my best friend. <br><br>
I’m not in love with him. <br>
No way, no how. <br>
I don’t care what everyone else says.<br>
I’m rambling, aren’t I. <br>
Let me start from the beginning.

<h3>Seven years ago</h3>
<p class="lead">
I won a scholarship in a prestigious university from the west. My late father’s friend, Uncle Logan had an apartment near the institution, so he rented a room to me at a heavily discounted price. The apartment’s enormous. The other tenants were close to my age, so I’d have friends there.<br><br>

<b>Day one.</b> <br><br>
Uncle Logan picked me up from the airport. I hadn’t seen him in person for years, but he sent letters to our family a few times each year. Snail mail. That’s how archaic he was.<br><br>
“Emunah,” he flashed a brilliant grin. “Drop ‘Uncle’ and call me ‘Logan’.”<br><br>
He looked much younger than I expected. Though he wouldn’t tell me his actual age, he had to be at most ten years older than me. He’s kind of hot. But hey, he’s my late father’s friend, so that ick factor remained.<br><br>
He introduced me to his tenants once we got to the apartment. They were all guys. No girls. Each busy with whatever he’s doing. We’ve got nothing in common. While unpacking, I stared out of the window at the magnificent view of a lagoon surrounded by pine trees.<br><br>
Uncle Logan, I mean, Logan left for work after the round of introductions. That left me to my own devices.<br><br>
It’s winter here. The water’s frozen which makes it perfect for ice skating. Back home, the only time I got to skate was at ice skating rinks in Tel Aviv which was a long bus ride away. This pond’s within walking distance.<br><br>
So, there I was, full gear on, gliding on an actual lake surrounded by trees.  I was taking in the beautiful scenery around me, when the ice beneath me cracked.<br><br>
Stupid me!<br><br>
There must have been a reason why no one else was skating that day. I assumed they were all in their offices.<br><br>
I lay flat on the ground as the crack spread into a spider’s web beneath me.<br><br>
“Help!” I screamed, rolling away, to thicker ice.<br>
Too late, that chunk holding me up gave way.<br>
I sank through stinging cold beneath, dreading the icy death that awaited.
