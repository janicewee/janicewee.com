	Emunah is the middle of three sisters in a Messianic Jewish family in Jerusalem. Her father sent her to study in a prestigious school in the West when she was a teenager. He rented a room from his friend Logan who owned a building near the school. She continued renting that room after she graduated and got a job in that city.<br><br>
The landlord rented the apartment to several tenants, each taking a separate room but sharing the living room and kitchen. Over the years, she became close friends with her fellow tenants, Leo and Oliver.<br><br>
She's five feet six, is a bit of a tomboy and has a massive crush on her best friend, Jayden, though she'd never admit it.<br><br>
She's the central figure of the series. Although she is raptured early in the story, she touched the lives of many of the key players who continue through the apocalypse, into the Millenial rule and the final rebellion. (Am I giving too much away here?)<Br><br>
In any case, there are many story arcs and mini plots throughout the books which are fast paced, multi-faceted, page turners.

Stalker refused to leave her alone.<br><br>
The incident led Emunah and her friends to investigate Beast Corp. Leo in particular obsessed with the implications of emerging technology. He roped Emunah and Oliver into his investigations, which led to their encounter with aliens an the occult.
