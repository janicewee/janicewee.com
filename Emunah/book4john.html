<h3 class="mt-4">Overview</h3> 
<p class="lead">

In the heart of contemporary fiction, Emunah Short Stories Book 4: John dives deep into the trials and triumphs of a true underdog. John, a frail and quiet young man, is relentlessly bullied by Don, who kicks sand in his face at the beach. Determined to transform his life and reclaim his dignity, John steps into the world of weightlifting. In the gym, he meets Eli, a seasoned bodybuilder, who becomes his mentor, guiding him to build strength and stamina.
<br><br>
As John trains rigorously, his world is further shaken by his mother’s deteriorating health. Medical treatment is beyond their financial reach, and the legacy left by his late father was deceitfully stolen by Rabbi Caleb, who was trusted to manage the inheritance. Desperation leads John to discover a weightlifting contest with a grand prize that could cover his mother's medical expenses.
<br><br>
In this compelling story of an underdog, John's hero’s journey is vividly portrayed through elements of realistic fiction and bodybuilding. Will he have the strength to rise above his challenges and become a champion, both in the competition and in life?
<br><br>
Emunah Short Stories Book 4: John, by Janice Wee, is a gripping coming-of-age story that will inspire and captivate readers, making it a must-read in the realm of contemporary fiction books. Follow John's journey from being a bullied youth to a determined competitor, and witness the making of a true fictional hero.

<h3 class="mt-4">Excerpt</h3><br>
<p class="lead">
Samson killed a lion with his bare hands. He pulled up the gates of the city and carried them to the top of a hill at midnight as a prank. Samson, of the tribe of Dan, was John’s great (a great many greats) grandfather’s brother on his mother’s side. John’s father, and therefore John himself, was from the tribe of Benjamin. But hey, John still had Samson’s DNA through mom, so that counts. Sort of.<br><br>
Pride swelled in John’s heart as he reflected on his heritage. He studied the man in the mirror, examining his smooth spaghetti-like arms, a product of his sedentary lifestyle. Lifting books didn’t help his physique. Maybe he should keep his hair long? It worked for Samson.
