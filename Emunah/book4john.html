<p class="lead">

In the heart of contemporary fiction, Emunah Short Stories Book 4: John dives deep into the trials and triumphs of a true underdog. John, a frail and quiet young man, is relentlessly bullied by Don, who kicks sand in his face at the beach. Determined to transform his life and reclaim his dignity, John steps into the world of weightlifting. In the gym, he meets Eli, a seasoned bodybuilder, who becomes his mentor, guiding him to build strength and stamina.
<br><br>
As John trains rigorously, his world is further shaken by his mother’s deteriorating health. Medical treatment is beyond their financial reach, and the legacy left by his late father was deceitfully stolen by Rabbi Caleb, who was trusted to manage the inheritance. Desperation leads John to discover a weightlifting contest with a grand prize that could cover his mother's medical expenses.
<br><br>
In this compelling story of an underdog, John's hero’s journey is vividly portrayed through elements of realistic fiction and bodybuilding. Will he have the strength to rise above his challenges and become a champion, both in the competition and in life?
<br><br>

<h3 class="mt-4">Chapter 1</h3><br>
<p class="lead">
Samson killed a lion with his bare hands. He pulled up the gates of the city and carried them to the top of a hill at midnight as a prank. Samson, of the tribe of Dan, was John’s great (a great many greats) grandfather’s brother on his mother’s side. John’s father, and therefore John himself, was from the tribe of Benjamin. But hey, John still had Samson’s DNA through mom, so that counts. Sort of.<br><br>
Pride swelled in John’s heart as he reflected on his heritage. He studied the man in the mirror, examining his smooth spaghetti-like arms, a product of his sedentary lifestyle. Lifting books didn’t help his physique. Maybe he should keep his hair long? It worked for Samson.
<br><br>
Who was he kidding?<br><br>
He’s weak and fatigued of late. It was affecting his work. He didn’t have any energy left after his studies for community events. Hence his appointment at the clinic.<br><br>
After a morning of checkups and tests, his doctor pronounced the verdict.<br><br>
“Do I have cancer?” John voiced his worst fears. “Or a chronic illness?” He bit his lip. “Is it fatal? How long do I have to live?”<br><br>
“Relax, son.” The edges of the doctor’s eyes crinkled with his smile. “You don’t have any health issues at the moment.”<br><br>
“I don’t?” Relief washed over John. “Then why am I always so tired?”<br><br>
“It’s because of your sedentary lifestyle. Get away from your books. Go outdoors for fresh air and physical exercise and you will feel better,” the doctor patted his shoulder before dismissing him.
<br><br><br><br>

John had the rest of the day off so he decided to spend his time following the good doctor’s advice. So here he was at the beach, staring at the vibrant blue sea. Cool, salty breeze tickled his cheeks. The fresh marine smell uplifted him. If this was the medicine the doctor prescribed, he’d gladly take it. As for physical activity, the long walk counted.<br><br>
He sat on his new beach mat and bit into a tuna sandwich, relishing his savoury, creamy treat… and gagged. Gritty sand sprayed his face, getting into his eyes, his mouth and his lunch.<br><br>
A burly guy, more than John’s twice size, kicked sand in his face. <br><br>
Outraged, John confronted the man. “What’s that about?” <br><br>
“I’d smash your face,” laughed the bully. “But you’re so skinny, the wind would blow you away.”
It’s true that John had an enviable waistline. At twenty-four inches, or sixty centimetres, young women wished their own waists were as tiny as his. Or so he heard. <br><br>
As if to prove a point, the rascal lifted John with one hand. Furious, John struggled to break free from his iron grip, to no avail. The monster shoved John face-first into the sand, laughing.<br><br>
The beautiful woman who accompanied his tormentor mocked John. “Don’t let my man bother you little boy.” She scrutinised John with disdain before sauntering off after the ruffian.<br><br>
Dusting off the sand, John tried to salvage his lunch without any success. Fuelled by rage, John decided to change. He would be like Samson.
