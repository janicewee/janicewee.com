<h3 class="mt-4">Chapter 1</h3><br>
<p class="lead">
Have you ever had the feeling that someone or something is watching you? You feel eyes boring through you, but when you look up, there’s no one around.<br><br>

That was the case in Denver’s old house.<br><br>

He’s gone. Presumed dead with his wife, their ashes mixed and sent home in an ornate box from the East. It was a holiday gone wrong. <br><br>

“Daddy’s ghost visited me last week. He told me Aaron is with him and Mummy in hell,” she shuddered. “Mummy visited after that, then Aaron, confirming Daddy’s story.”<br><br>

Oliver wrapped his arms around his baby sister, drawing her into a hug. “Those are familiar spirits masquerading as Daddy, Mummy and Aaron. Ignore them.”<br><br>

Lydia froze as she stared into empty air. “They’re not happy with you. They want you to quit going to church.”
<br><br>
An eerie chill swept the room as an apparition appeared. <br>
Oliver cried, “I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, to leave!”<br>
The strange thing vanished. The oppression lifted.<br>
Peace reigned once more in the house.
<br><br>
“You chased Daddy, Mummy and Aaron away,” Lydia chided her eldest brother. “They keep me company every night.”<br><br>

Oliver had long since moved out of the family home. Lydia lived alone, surrounded by memories of their departed family.<br><br>

“What?” Oliver stood dumbfounded as his sister stormed away. His eyes fell on the lacquered box on the living room mantle. It gave him the creeps. Their contacts claimed they had seen both parents killed, and their bodies burned by the mob. The authorities sent boxes that contained ashes of the victims to their families in the aftermath of the massacre. <br><br>

Wiping angry tears from his eyes, he doubted if that box held his parents remains. Lydia’s rejection of her faith and embrace of strange doctrine coincided with its entry into their family home. He would have thrown it out. Burned it, if not for Lydia’s vehement protests. <br><br>

Sighing, he sunk into a chair and stared at his phone.<br><br>

A viral video made its way to his news feed. A savage with a metal spear saved a teenager from a wild boar. The camera focused on the bearded man for a split second, before the man escaped into the woods.<br><br>

Oliver replayed the video, freezing it to examine the wild man’s face. He knew those eyes. That’s his father. His dad’s death was a sham!<br><br>
“The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. John 10:10 KJV,” Oliver meditated on the verse as he closed the Bible his father had given him when he was ten.<br><br>
Considering what’s been happening in the family home with Lydia, it made perfect sense. New Age teachings fascinated Lydia. That fascination turned into an obsession. Now, she’s communing with familiar spirits impersonating their parents and late brother.<br><br>
Sighing, Oliver resolved to investigate his father’s disappearance, but with a fresh mind. Such thoughts filling his mind, he drifted asleep.<br><br>
The streets were busy even though it was late at night. <br>
Brothels thrived beside casinos. Gaudy lights and heavy drums set the scene for blatant debauchery. The streets reeked of alcohol. And vomit. <br>
It was a regular Saturday night in the city’s entertainment hub. Lust hung heavy as a temptress sashayed towards Oliver. Her alluring scent enveloping him, drew him into her web. <br>
“Oliver,” the siren murmured, her seductive eyes held him captive. “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”<br>
The young man wavered, before tearing himself away. It wasn’t right. He fled.<br>
A man possessed of beauty that was not of this world strode through the sweaty mess of bodies that were bouncing to throbbing music. He observed these in silence, like a hunter assessing his prey.  <br><br>
The man was of indeterminate age. His hair, long and fair, flowed as if blown by the wind, though the air was still. He glowed with an eerie light, as if illuminated from within. Precious stones adorned his apparel, which highlighted his pale complexion. <br><br>
Mesmerised by the sight of this stranger gliding through the unsuspecting crowd, Oliver followed him. He seemed invisible to all but Oliver. <br><br>
The scene shifted. <br>
Oliver walked down the street during the morning rush hour. <br>
Cars honking. People waiting at the bus stop. The strange man prowled through the crowd, striding through all obstacles as if they did not exist. He moved with the grace and deadliness of a lion.<br><br>
The strange man stopped.<br><br>
Pale eyes of unearthly hues held Oliver in their sway, mesmerising him the way a cobra enthrals its prey. Ancient evil exuded from the stunning being as it made a beeline towards its helpless target.<br><br>
“Jesus!” <br><br>
When the strangled cry left Oliver’s throat, the stranger vanished. <br><br>
Oliver jolted awake, drenched in sweat.
