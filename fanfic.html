        <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">I loved reading the old Captain Marvel comics where he was chosen because of his pure heart. He was orphaned. His uncle who was supposed to care for him threw him out yet he never stole nor lashed out at others, unlike Earth 0&rsquo;s Shazam. Unfortunately, DC stopped publishing Captain Marvel and replaced him with Shazam. If you&rsquo;ve read those comics from the time he was called Shazam onwards, you&rsquo;d realize he&rsquo;s a completely different character altogether.<br><br>
I missed the original Captain Marvel so much, I started writing fan fiction with stories I want to read. Then I shared my fan fics with other original Captain Marvel fans on <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Jam5/pseuds/Jam5">AO3</a>. At one point, I organised my stories in chronological order in my Wattpad fan fic <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/317187119-the-secret-life-of-billy-captain-marvel-batson">The Secret Life of Billy Batson</a> but I have written so many new fics since then, it&rsquo;s a big mess. I plan to use this site to organize them for your reading pleasure.<br><br>
DC had amazing stories going on for Captain Marvel which were abandoned. Possibilities never pursued. My fan fics pick up where those tales left off.<br><br>
I took a break from writing fan fic for a few months in order to write my first novel ever. <a href="https://www.janicewee.com/Emunah/book3.html"><b>The Quest for Immortality</b></a>.
That's completed now and I'm planning another Billy Batson fan fiction. Working title for now is <a href="https://www.janicewee.com/fanfic2.html"><b>A New Adventure</b></a> until I've got the plot out and a proper name for it. I'll keep you updated <a href="https://www.janicewee.com/fanfic2.html">here</a>.

In JSA #47 
Todd pulls his dad, Alan Scott, The Sentinel into the Shadow Realms. Captain Marvel and Stargirl fly in to rescue him. <br><br>
The Shadow Realms cut Captain Marvel off from the Wizard Shazam&rsquo;s power. Lightning strikes him, reverting him back to Billy right in front of Stargirl.

<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/40532604">Love at First Splat</a> is a slapstick look at Billy&rsquo;s encounter with Courtney Whitmore before he joins the Justice Society. It&rsquo;s love at first sight. The mouse detectives (original characters I created) counsel the lovesick boy. <br><br>
Two years later, Captain Marvel and Stargirl, on a JSA adventure, land up in another universe where Captain Marvel cannot access his powers and reverts to Billy. It&rsquo;s a nod to the JSA series.

In JSA #48: 
In Shadow Lands while searching for Alan Scott, Billy and Courtney fall in love. What follows in the next issues is a sweet romance I&rsquo;d put right up there, in the same category as the Peter Parker/Mary Jane. They were so good together. They could dethrone Superman/Lois Lane romance in DC if given the chance.

In Black Adam/JSA Black Reign, 
Courtney isn&rsquo;t the damsel in distress waiting for Captain Marvel to rescue her. On the contrary, she rescues Billy as much as he saves her. They are equals. Partners. They treat each other as such.

In Black Adam/JSA Black reign Part 2: <br><br>
Other than Stargirl and Black Adam, no one in the JSA knows that Captain Marvel is really a sixteen-year-old boy. Jay Garrick, The Flash, senses there&rsquo;s something going on between Marvel and Courtney and it looks bad. He confronts Marvel about it.<br><br>
Rather than revealing his real age, Billy lets Jay think he&rsquo;s an adult who is romantically interested in a teenage girl and breaks up with Courtney.

In Black Adam and Isis<br><br>
When Isis steals Marvel&rsquo;s power and he reverts to Billy, unable to transform, he contacts the JSA for help. It&rsquo;s only then that he reveals his secret to his former team mates. What follows is a sweet reunion between Billy and Courtney which I absolutely loved. At the end of it, the Wizard Shazam takes back his power and Courtney loses interest in him, falling for Atom Smasher instead.

In First Thunder:<br><br>
In the mini series, Superman teamed up with Captain Marvel to investigate museum robberies that hit Metropolis and Fawcett. The two became fast friends.<br><br>
Back then, Billy had a best friend who would visit him in the subway where they would have out. That boy, Scott Okum was killed in gunfire meant for Billy. Captain Marvel lost it and confronted the mastermind. The resulting destruction made the news which led to Superman confronting Cap. <br><br>
Billy revealed his secret to Superman, which led to this panel at the end of the story.
