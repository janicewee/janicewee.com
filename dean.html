            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Dean</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">At just three years old, Dean is a delightful bundle of energy and joy. He is often found trailing his elder sister, delighting in the outdoor activities and pranks orchestrated by his siblings.
</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Dean thrives in rough play, assuming the role of superheroes, engaging in playful fights with makeshift weapons, and navigating the rough and tumble of childhood with infectious laughter. Among all the siblings and cousins, Dean's speed is unmatched. His involvement in their adventures stems from both his relentless determination and his siblings' belief that he's safer accompanying them rather than being left alone.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">As the youngest of the group, Dean is cherished by all, yet remains unspoiled. He displays a rare consideration for others at his tender age. Dean's appetite matches his boundless energy, eating just about anything placed before him. His energy ensures he burns off what he consumes just as quickly.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">When the day's adventures have wound down and things grow quiet, Dean loves nothing more than to fall into a deep sleep, unless his curiosity prompts him to wander off on his own.</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Pesky snoopers,&rdquo; spat one of the guards. He dragged Dean in with him. <br><br>
The guard following him had Scott. &ldquo;More ransom for us,&rdquo; he cackled.<br><br>
Cassie rolled a stink bomb under the heavier guard&rsquo;s foot. The satisfying crunch as heel broke glass was music to her ears.<br><br>
&ldquo;Did you fart?&rdquo; Crinkling his nose, the smaller guard glared at his heavy companion.<br><br>
The stench of rotten eggs filled the room. The guards gagged.<br><br>
Scott bit his captor.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; He let go of the bigger boy. &ldquo;Brat!&rdquo;<br><br>
Following his big brother&rsquo;s example, Dean sunk his teeth into his guard&rsquo;s arm.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; The man released Dean. The boy fled.
