            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Arnott Merritt is the ring leader of the group, a huge, muscular man who is physically very strong and dwarfs everyone else. He believes that whites are the colonial masters and that colored people are subservient to whites. Joining the ship for adventure, money, fame, and girls, Arnott seeks revenge against perceived slights by the Chinese crew members. His conflict lies in the balance between his hurt pride and his desire to climb the career ladder under a captain who does not tolerate racism. When Ah Cheng saves his life during a pirate attack, Arnott's life takes a turn, and he becomes firm friends with Ah Cheng.</p>

<blockquote>Arnott Merritt, the red headed leader of the trio, grabbed Ah Cheng&rsquo;s shirt. Lifting him with both his hands, he slammed Ah Cheng against the wall.<br><br>
&ldquo;Mind your own business.&rdquo; He growled the shark-like gorilla of a man.<br><br>
Ah Cheng shook his head so hard, if it were detachable, it would fly off.

            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Oswaldo Travis appears to be Arnott Merritt's good friend and right-hand man but is actually manipulating Arnott. He joins the ship for the same reasons as Arnott and seeks revenge against the Chinese crew members. As the mastermind behind the hauntings, Oswaldo aims to find and keep the hidden treasure for himself, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Okay. Out with it,&rdquo; Oswaldo ambushed Stanley when he boarded The Everingham. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The tip of his dagger pricked Stanley&rsquo;s throat like a viper&rsquo;s fangs.<br><br>
Raising his hands in mock surrender, Stanley replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Stanley. A mate of The Everingham.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No. Who. Are. You?&rdquo; Oswaldo&rsquo;s dagger drew blood.<br><br>
The cut stung. Stanley ignored the warm blood trickling down his neck. In a swift move, Oswaldo&rsquo;s dagger was in his hand. He flicked it into the sea.<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report you for stealing my dagger,&rdquo; Oswaldo hissed.

His primary motivation is to see the world and make a name for himself. However, Ted faces internal conflict as his conscience wrestles with his actions. Throughout the story, he learns that all men bleed red blood and becomes more tolerant. Ted is a loyal friend of Arnott Merritt.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Has anyone seen Arnott?&rdquo; Huffing for breath, Ted Lawrence bumped into Stanley, both men falling over.<br><br>
&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; Stanley helped Ted to his feet.<br><br>
&ldquo;He asked me to get his kit for him, then when I turned around he was gone. I searched high and low but cannot find him. It&rsquo;s like he vanished in thin air,&rdquo; Ted spoke an octave higher than usual, his words fired in rapid succession, like a machine gun&rsquo;s bullets.<br><br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Of all people, Arnott can take care of himself,&rdquo; chuckled Stanley.
Right there and then, he choked on his own words.<br><br>
Officer Frederick Hardy walked past them. He held a disoriented Arnott in a fireman&rsquo;s carry. <br><br> &ldquo;Arnott&rsquo;s poisoned. Get Doctor Charles to the medical bay now.&rdquo;
