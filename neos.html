&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is that Jeffrey is better for you. At least he doesn&rsquo;t have a dark past,&rdquo; Annie shrugged. &ldquo;Has Stanley said a word to you about his life before he came here?&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Eve had to admit Stanley was tight-lipped about his past.<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say he killed someone and ran away to hide from the authorities,&rdquo; Annie lowered her voice in a conspiratorial whisper.<br><br>
&ldquo;No, he did not! Stanley is not like that!&rdquo; Eve glared at her crazy big sister.<br><br>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Annie persisted. &ldquo;Everyone knows that Serial killers are charming. That&rsquo;s how they catch their victims off guard.&rdquo;<br><br>
Slap!<br><br>
&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Annie&rsquo;s face had a hand-shaped pink mark.

<blockquote> 
The old angsana tree brushed against her window. Opening it wide, she scampered onto the huge branch like a squirrel. Her skirt caught in a branch, tearing as she scampered down, then ran for freedom.<br><br>
Stanley spoke much about his love for freedom. He compared his past to the life of a canary in a gilded cage. That was exactly how she felt.<br><br>
He had told her where he lived after he&rsquo;d recovered from the snake bite. <br><br>
Heart thumping, lungs bursting, she ran towards the run-down inn. Yes, he&rsquo;s a poor man but she&rsquo;d rather live on sunshine and fresh air with the love of her life, than in luxury with Jeffrey whom she felt nothing for. <br><br>
As she approached the inn, a strong arm wrapped around her waist.
