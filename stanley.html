            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Meet Stanley, the Straits Born Chinese hero from Singapore, brought to life by author Janice Wee in her captivating novels, <a href="https://books2read.com/u/mV0WoM">Singapore's Runaway</a> and <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b5qeMR">Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer</a>. Born into a wealthy family, Stanley is an incredibly adaptable and resilient character, who values his freedom and despises being controlled.</p><p>After his mother's passing and his father's remarriage, Stanley runs away from home, seeking adventure and the chance to live life on his own terms. He joins the crew of the ship, <a href="everingham.html">The Everingham</a>, where he quickly adapts to the filthy, uncomfortable living conditions without complaint. Despite the ship's haunted reputation, Stanley finds friendship in <a href="ahcheng.html">Ah Cheng</a> and <a href="crew.html">fellow crew members</a> Tan Ah Kow, Ahmad, and Gopal. Together, they face racial discrimination and the cruelty of the sadistic <a href="white.html">white trio</a> led by Arnott Merritt.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Stanley, a strong bodybuilder and athlete, showcases his heroism by rescuing a drowning girl from the sea during a storm. He can carry four strong men on his own and take on up to five men in a fight. As a fearless character, he stands up against discrimination, earning the favor of the ship's Captain.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Despite the dangers and challenges, Stanley's thirst for adventure never wanes. He hides from bounty hunters at each of the ship's stops, sent by his family to bring him back home. To protect his identity, he keeps his past a secret from his friends, fearing they might betray him. During their journey, Stanley and his crewmates fight off pirates and enjoy the cuisine in Malaysia.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">In <a href="book1.html">Singapore's Runaway</a>, Stanley's journey with The Everingham crew comes to an end in Indonesia. This marks the beginning of his new adventure in <a href="book2.html">Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer</a>, where he meets and falls in love with his soulmate, Eve Neo. Stanley remains faithful to Eve even as Belle pursues him. He stands by Eve's side as a pillar of strength when a serial killer strikes close to home.</p>
<p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">While in Indonesia, Stanley encounters his stepuncle <a href="george.html">George</a>, who he suspects is hunting for him. To avoid detection, he adopts the name "Adam" and works with George to catch the serial killer. Stanley is a proud man with strong principles and always does what he believes is right.

<blockquote>
Picking up a brush, he started painting beside Ah Cheng. &ldquo;The map may not lead to anything valuable. Real money is on the runaway from Singapore,&rdquo; Ah Kow&rsquo;s excitement infected his crewmates. You could see the dollar signs in their eyes. &ldquo;The grapevine says he slipped into a ship leaving Singapore and joined the crew.&rdquo;<br><br>
Stanley&rsquo;s stomach dropped like a rock. Pulling himself together he shrugged. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t believe everything you hear.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;Stanley&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Gopal stepped back to admire his work. &ldquo;Why would a rich man&rsquo;s spoiled son join a ship as a crew member. Even if he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t last a week.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;My sources say he&rsquo;s a strapping young man, proud and strong,&rdquo; replied Ah Kow. &ldquo;For all you know, he&rsquo;s hiding on some ship we might encounter.&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;With that bounty on him, he&rsquo;s a walking treasure chest.&rdquo;<br><br>
Stanley&rsquo;s ship mates talked about tracking down the runaway at the next port for a shot at the bounty.<br><br>
&ldquo;Water needs changing.&rdquo; With a huff, Stanley picked up the large bucket of dirty water and walked away. <br><br>
His mind racing on potential betrayal should they find the truth, he caught sight of a looming ship.<br><br> Dread washed over him.<br><br>
The Lotus.

<blockquote>&ldquo;Ah Kow? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Stanley turned to his friend.<br><br>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t talk now,&rdquo; the guy&rsquo;s eyes darted at Eve. &ldquo;Meet me at 3pm today. Don&rsquo;t be late,&rdquo; he slipped Stanley a note. Then he ran off.<br><br>
&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Curiosity piqued; Eve elbowed the hunk.<br><br>
&ldquo;An over dramatic friend of mine,&rdquo; shrugged Stanley. <br><br>
&ldquo;He acts like someone is hunting him,&rdquo; she giggled.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ah Kow&rsquo;s paranoid,&rdquo; laughed Stanley. &ldquo;There was this time when he told me a ghost was after him.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo; the blood drained from Eve&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;At one of the benches in the marketplace, under a tree,&rdquo; Stanley lowered his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;He claimed a spirit lives in that tree.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; Goosebumps formed on Eve&rsquo;s skin. &ldquo;Was there a ghost?&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;It attacked while we were talking. We saw something white hidden in the tree above us,&rdquo; Stanley looked so serious. &ldquo;There was a screech. Then sharp claws dug into his head, like that.&rdquo; Stanley fingers slid on her head.<br><br>
Eve screamed.<br><br>
Stanley laughed as she hit him with a carrot.
