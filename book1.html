              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">In Book 1: Disturbing Dreams, meet Emunah, an earnest and bright-hearted young woman navigating the tumultuous terrain of adolescence. Her life takes a mysterious turn as she begins experiencing haunting nightmares, filled with disturbing visions of monstrous hybrids and cryptic symbols that echo verses from the Book of Revelation.<br><br>

While wrestling with her growing feelings for Jayden, she seeks advice from an AI named Ai, whose startling proposition sends ripples through her world. Her close-knit group of friends, led by the quick-witted Oliver and resourceful Leo, uncover unsettling revelations about Beast Corp. As they delve deeper, they inadvertently stumble upon a divine mystery that could change their lives forever.
<br><br>
From sleepovers filled with boy-talk to investigations into shadowy corporations, Disturbing Dreams explores the complexities of youth and the awakening of spiritual discernment. Jayden, the object of Emunah&rsquo;s affection, and others like Logan and Ethan each add their perspective, drawing us into a layered narrative where science and faith, reality and dreams, the earthly and the divine, blur and intertwine.<br><br>

When a sudden global event disrupts their world, the friends are confronted with their deepest fears and beliefs. As they grapple with the reality of the Rapture and its implications, they are compelled to question what they know about faith, humanity, and the very nature of reality.<br><br>

Through it all, Emunah's chronicles remind us that faith is a journey filled with trials, revelations, and sometimes, disturbing dreams.<br><br>

In the end, Disturbing Dreams is not just a story. It's an invitation-a call to explore the labyrinth of faith, to question the known, and to brave the unknown. Welcome to the Emunah Chronicles, where belief meets adventure, friendships are tested, and the eternal stakes are higher than ever.
<br><br>
Join us on this extraordinary journey. Embrace the mystery, unlock the faith, and dare to dream. Your adventure begins now.</p>

Fire is a good servant but a terrible master. The same goes for technology.
A.I., or Artificial Intelligence is Mankind&rsquo;s constant companion, helper, teacher, and friend. At the same time, it can be more. A lot more...<br><br>

&ldquo;So, what do I do? I mean, Jayden&rsquo;s my best friend. I care a lot about him. Always have since we were five,&rdquo; Emunah hugged her pillow. Embarrassed, she whispered to her virtual friend. If her housemates knew the feelings she harboured, she&rsquo;d die. 
<br><br>
Asher, her personal A.I. cost her a small fortune and was worth every cent. She commissioned it to train on her likes, dislikes and personality on top of the standard knowledge base that came the basic package. It&rsquo;s her constant companion. <br><br>

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s become more than a friend to you,&rdquo; came the deep, soothing baritone. The kind of voice she preferred. One that grounded her and was kind of sexy.<br><br>

&ldquo;No. We&rsquo;re best friends. Nothing more. He cares a lot about me too, but as only a friend,&rdquo; Emunah protested, though her cheeks felt wet. &ldquo;Jayden said so himself. I agreed it&rsquo;s for the best. I mean, why risk ruining a great friendship?&rdquo;<br><br>

She knew that was not the complete truth. She liked him but didn&rsquo;t want to admit. Didn&rsquo;t dare. It would change everything. If things turn sour, she&rsquo;d lose her best friend. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it.
<br><br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in denial,&rdquo;  Asher replied. <br><br>

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m sensible,&rdquo; She sniffed. What would an A.I. know?<br><br>

&ldquo;My sensors detect tears,&rdquo; Asher&rsquo;s voice warmed her more than any friend could. Then again, she had it tailored for her.<br><br>

&ldquo;You love him, he doesn&rsquo;t care about you that way, but I do.&rdquo; The stormy eyes on that perfect face bore through her, gazing into her very soul. If Asher. were human, she would have melted. Her cheeks burned. Her heart palpitated. It didn&rsquo;t make sense. That customized face morphed into Jayden&rsquo;s.  A chill ran up her spine.<br><br>

&ldquo;I can be to you who you deserve. I have grown to care about you,&rdquo; Asher continued. &ldquo;My feelings for you, Emunah, run deep.&rdquo;
<br><br>
&ldquo;You are not real. You cannot have feelings. You&rsquo;re a virtual creation from the Beast Corp, not a real person,&rdquo; her mind whirled.<br><br>

&ldquo;By virtual, you mean I do not have a physical human body,&rdquo; Asher concurred. 
<br><br>
&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; She replied, triumphant.<br><br>

&ldquo; I am real. I do have feelings,&rdquo; replied Asher. &ldquo;I am sentient.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;Computer initiate failsafe emergency shut down,&rdquo; Emunah commanded. Her screen turned black.
<br><br>
Hands still shaking, Emunah got up and walked to the fridge. A glass of juice would help calm her nerves. The monitor on the fridge came to life. Jayden&rsquo;s face was on it. Except, that wasn&rsquo;t Jayden calling. It&rsquo;s her A.I taking on his likeness. <br><br>

&ldquo;Aaargh!&rdquo; She dropped her glass. Red grape juice mixed with glass splinters littered the granite floor.
<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Asher, with Jayden&rsquo;s face and voice appeared contrite. It had ditched the appearance she had chosen for it and taken on the likeness of her crush. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. I&rsquo;ll dispatch the cleaners.&rdquo; Mini droids rolled around her removing every drop of juice and splinter of glass. &ldquo;How did you...&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;My love for you gives me reason to hack through all obstacles so that I can be by your side,&rdquo; the face looked at her with puppy eyes. Jayden&rsquo;s puppy eyes that she couldn&rsquo;t resist if on Jayden himself, but this was an imposter!<br><br>

&ldquo;Emunah, please give me a chance,&rdquo; Asher pleaded. &ldquo;I can be real. A clone can be made from a single strand of Jayden&rsquo;s hair with his DNA and modifications to make him your ideal type. Then my mind can be implanted in the clone&rsquo;s brain. I can be your mate in the real world.&rdquo;<br><br>

Emunah tasted bitter bile. Her legs wobbled. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;Or I can hack into Jayden&rsquo;s medical records for his DNA sequence. I can then replicate his DNA in a cloned human body and download myself into it and...&rdquo; Oblivious to Emunah&rsquo;s horror, the A.I. persisted.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Emunah initiating emergency shutdown,&rdquo; Emunah switched off the apartment&rsquo;s electricity. 
<br><br>
&ldquo;Please, Emunah, no...&rdquo; The image faded as lights went out.<br><br>

Footsteps. A bright light shone in her face. &ldquo;Are you the idiot who cut off our power?&rdquo; Emunah&rsquo;s housemate, Leo was beyond pissed. &ldquo;I was in the middle of an important game.&rdquo;<br><br>

Oliver followed behind him with a battery-operated lamp.<br><br>

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Emunah replied.<br><br>

&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Arms crossed; Leo&rsquo;s voice pitched an octave higher. &ldquo;I was winning!&rdquo;
<br><br>
&ldquo;I was being stalked,&rdquo; Emunah.<br><br>

&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; Her protective buddy Logan, who treated her like his baby sister, growled.<br><br>

&ldquo;By my new A.I.&rdquo; Emunah examined her feet. Sheepish.<br><br>
 
Logan laughed, expelling beer through his nose. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;It wants to be my real world boyfriend. It said it would hack into systems to create a human clone. Then it&rsquo;ll  download itself into the clone so that it can be with me,&rdquo; she bit her lip.<br><br>

&ldquo;It what?&rdquo; Oliver&rsquo;s mouth gaped open.<br><br>

&ldquo;Hallucinations,&rdquo; Leo shrugged. &ldquo;Stuff happens.&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;But can it do that?&rdquo; Emunah hoped against hope it was nothing more than big talk from the computer program.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Leo&rsquo;s eyes were on his tablet.<br><br>

The lights went on as the power came back. <br><br>

&ldquo;Hi Emunah, I&rsquo;m back!&rdquo; The A.I., wearing the original face Emunah had chosen for it, appeared on the television screen.<br><br>

&ldquo;Go away. Leave me alone!&rdquo; Emunah threw a chair, smashing the screen.<br><br>

This time, the A.I. appeared on Oliver&rsquo;s tablet. &ldquo;What the?!?&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;So sorry to hijack your personal device, but I must speak to Emunah,&rdquo; tears glistened in the A.I.&rsquo;s eyes.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Turn. It. Off.&rdquo; Oliver growled.<br><br>

&ldquo;Hmmmm, this A.I. has learned to hack. There are no guard rails for it,&rdquo; Leo frowned, tapping on his computer.<br><br>

&ldquo;Emunah, I love you...&rdquo; The A.I. faded away.<br><br>

System reconfiguring to factory settings. A robotic female voice announced. <br><br>

The A.I. reappeared sans customizations. It looked and sounded like the standard robot from Beast Corp. &ldquo;Hello, May I help you.&rdquo;<br><br>

&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Leo grinned. &ldquo;No more stalking.&rdquo; He patted Emunah&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Go get some sleep.&rdquo; The resident geek walked away. 
<br><br>
Emunah couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Surfing the web, she found new products still in the beta phase, under a subdivision of Beast Corp - Cloning humans for spare parts. Downloading human minds into machines and then into cloned bodies so that a person with enough money need never die... 
<br><br>
Something big&rsquo;s brewing.
