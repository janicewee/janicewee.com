            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Scott from "Naughty Little Nonya"</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">At ten years old, Scott is an extraordinary genius and a passionate bookworm. An introvert at heart, he gravitates towards his books and chemistry kits rather than outdoor activities or parties. As Cassie's elder brother, and the eldest among the cousins and siblings, Scott embraces his role with a distinct fondness for science.
</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Despite his tender age, Scott's knowledge in Science surpasses that of many college tutors. Often, he can be found with his nose buried deep in a book, so engrossed that he often locks himself in the toilet for hours on end, forgetting to emerge.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Scott's genius extends to his ability to build his own gadgets, including stink bombs and various weapons from his science kit, all designed to outsmart burglars and other adversaries. Although tall for his age, he lacks physical strength, speed, and agility, often joking about his two left feet.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">This doesn't deter him though. He leverages his intelligence, forming the brains of their crime-busting operations, and defers the physical aspects of their plans to Cassie. A tech whiz, Scott can hack through anything and conducts detailed research to provide the necessary information to crack their cases.</p>

<blockquote><br><br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them see you. Meet Scott in the playhouse,&rdquo; Cassie hung up. This is going to be fun!<br><br>
&ldquo;Scott, Tammy, we got work to do,&rdquo; she lowered her voice. &ldquo;Two burglars are breaking in. Scott, we need your kit to teach them a lesson,&rdquo; she snickered as she shared her sinister plan with her big brother.<br><br>
With a huge grin on his face, Scott busied himself, mixing chemicals, creating weapons of mass destruction for tormenting the intruders.<br><br>
&ldquo;Done yet?&rdquo; Cassie tapped her foot. Why was Scott taking so long? <br><br>
&ldquo;I need more time,&rdquo; he frowned. &ldquo;These things take time.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll delay them,&rdquo; she smirked. &ldquo;Send Tammy over with the rest of the stuff when you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;<br><br>
Scott&rsquo;s earlier experiments created slippery goo, smoke bombs and super sticky adhesive. With these in hand, Cassie stalked into the living room.
