            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Jim Tan is Stanley's strict father who has plans for his son to take over the administrative side of the family business in Singapore. Amelia Wong, now Amelia Tan, is Jim's new wife and Stanley's stepmother. She has her own plans to find a suitable wife for Stanley. Their marriage is strained by Stanley's resentment and disappearance, with Amelia feeling guilty about his departure and using her family's resources to search for him.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Amelia Wong in Singapore's Runaway</h1>
<blockquote>His new Mum, Amelia Wong, was the younger sister of Dad&rsquo;s business partner George. They had fallen in love while sourcing for spices in British India. Stanley zoned out. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the bimbo he now had to call Mum. She didn&rsquo;t look old enough to be his elder sister. <br><br>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve found the perfect match for Stanley.&rdquo; Amelia had the audacity to pinch his cheek. &ldquo;The matchmaker will come next week to kick off the marriage customs. A fine young man like you deserves the best.&rdquo; <br><br>
This had to be a bad dream. It&rsquo;s a sick joke. He stared as his now starry-eyed Dad. Then at Amelia. He was not calling her mum. Ever.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Amelia Wong in Two Worlds, One Love and a Serial Killer</h1>
<blockquote> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for Stanley while I&rsquo;m there,&rdquo; he caressed his dear sister&rsquo;s cheek. Dear Amelia blamed herself for everything. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in denial. I know the boy left because of me,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s heartbroken.&rdquo; Amelia had shared that Jim&rsquo;s heartache over his runaway son strained their marriage. For that reason, she roped all her brothers in to bring the boy home.<br><br>
&ldquo;How goes the search?&rdquo; George leaned forward.<br><br>
&ldquo;Our brothers have searched islands around Singapore - Malaysia, Indonesia, even the Philippines,&rdquo; Amelia ran her hands over her face. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;Looking for that boy is like searching for a needle in a haystack,&rdquo; George frowned. &ldquo;He could be anywhere.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s still alive,&rdquo; Amelia&rsquo;s lip trembled.
