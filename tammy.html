            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Tammy is a seven-year-old Nonya girl living in the Katong area of Singapore, in the Straits Born Chinese community. She resides with her beloved grandfather, whom she affectionately calls Ah Kong, her aunt Koko, and her parents in a quaint little house with a garden full of fruit trees and rose bushes.
</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Tammy is quite a character. Often blur as sotong, a term denoting her clumsy and confused nature, she's unintentionally ingenious at driving adults up the wall. A bookworm with an overactive imagination, she loves acting out the stories she's read, heard, or seen on television. Just like her cousins, she can transform into a wild child when the situation demands it.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Tammy's propensity to get lost easily leads to frequent troublesome adventures. Whether it's her cousins saving her from kidnappers, her Grandpa rescuing her from a fire, or her dad salvaging a basement she flooded, she's always in the middle of some escapade. Her mother often exasperates at her antics, and her grandma is caught between laughter and tears.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Despite her mischievous nature, Tammy is full of affection. She adores her Grandpa and is undoubtedly a Daddy's girl. Her elder sister/cousin, Cassie, is her hero.</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget the snowstorm,&rdquo; Casey picked a jumbo tube of talcum powder.
<br><br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Tammy squealed, excitement growing, anticipating the next wild game.<br><br>
&ldquo;Ice skating!&rdquo; Casey&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, bright as stars.
<br><br>
With great diligence, the girls powdered the floor of the entire apartment. <br><br>
&ldquo;Careful, Tam,&rdquo; Casey caught the younger girl as she slipped and fell yet again.<br><br>
Powdering the entire floor was back breaking work. Casey&rsquo;s balance was phenomenal. Not once did she fall.<br><br>
Tammy on the other hand couldn&rsquo;t take a few steps without landing on her now painful butt. How she envied her athletic big sister.
<br><br>
Clang.<br><br>
The gate. The key&rsquo;s turning. Tammy&rsquo;s heart leaped. They didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. There&rsquo;s not a fire in sight so why is she so scared that she wants to hide. Guilt? Over what?<br><br>

Daddy and Mummy said don&rsquo;t burn the house down. They were obedient. They didn&rsquo;t touch the matches.
