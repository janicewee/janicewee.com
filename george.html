            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600"><I>A Determined and Compassionate Man</I></p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">George Wong is a prominent character in Janice Wee's novels <a href="https://books2read.com/u/mV0WoM">Singapore's Runaway</a> and <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b5qeMR">Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer</a>. As Amelia's brother and Stanley's stepuncle, George plays a significant role in the lives of the central characters. He is introduced briefly in <a href="https://books2read.com/u/mV0WoM">Singapore's Runaway</a> but takes on a main role as the private detective pursuing the serial killer in <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b5qeMR">Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer</a>.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">George is a businessman who handles the Wong trading business. He also works as a private detective, actively fighting against opium addiction and its destruction of society. He investigates a murder case that he suspects is linked to the opium syndicates and eventually solves the crime from within a suspect's household.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">George helps Amelia search for her runaway stepson, Stanley, across the islands of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. His primary motivation is to ease his sister's distress and bring Stanley home, even if it means using force. However, as he gets to know Stanley, he develops empathy and understanding for his nephew's situation.</p>

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">George in Singapore's Runaway</h1>
<blockquote>Slurping the last of the gravy, a familiar face caught his eye. A fellow Straits Born Chinese man with a charismatic smile stood tall and proud in a sharp business suit.<br><br>
Stanley&rsquo;s stomach lurched. That&rsquo;s Uncle George. Stepmother&rsquo;s brother.<br><br>
He was talking to someone in the crowd.

<blockquote>&ldquo;Operation Krait commences in Ternate,&rdquo; Major Edward Whitaker was resolute.<br><br>
&ldquo;Oww!&rdquo; A large hand crushed George&rsquo;s shoulder, dragging him up. <br><br>
&ldquo;Ah Niu!&rdquo; Ahmad&rsquo;s menacing countenance terrified George. &ldquo;You want to die?&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; George cringed as the large man dumped him at Major Whitaker&rsquo;s feet.<br><br>
&ldquo;Found him snooping around,&rdquo; Ahmad shot George a look of disgust. &ldquo;I knew there&rsquo;s something off about you.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of him.&rdquo; Rupert&rsquo;s voice sent chills down George&rsquo;s spine.<br><br>
Major Whitaker kicked George aside, then turned to Rupert, his voice icy. &ldquo;You know what to do.&rdquo;
