Belle leaned forward. She smiled like a tiger with its eye on a deer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Belle, Eve&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; she fluttered her eyelashes. Then she took a few steps away, turning for a moment to throw him a kiss. <br><br>
Then she sashayed away on too high to be sensible heels.<br><br>
&ldquo;Does she behave like that to every guy she meets?&rdquo; Stanley sounded incredulous.<br><br>
&ldquo;Yes. If she doesn&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;s not Belle,&rdquo; Eve rolled her eyes.

            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Doctor Reverend Charles David Stone is a man of profound dedication. A skilled doctor and a devoted missionary, he brings solace and healing to the people of Ternate island in Indonesia. His life-saving intervention in Stanley's snakebite incident marks the beginning of an intricate tale of faith and resilience.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Doctor Reverend Stone in Two Worlds, One Love and a Serial Killer</h1>
<blockquote> 
With Eve safe at home, Stanley&rsquo;s free to follow his hunch. The serial killer uses snakes to poison victims. The snake bit him under the Frangipani tree near the entrance of the attap house&rsquo;s massive garden. He lived only because Eve got him to Doctor Reverend Stone&rsquo;s house in time to administer the anti-venom medicine. Victims who were not treated within an hour died.<br><br>
His gut says there&rsquo;s something bigger at play than killing off trespassers. When the time comes for the main event, if the killers want to be certain that victims don&rsquo;t survive, they must make sure victims cannot get anti-venom medicine in time. <br><br>
Doctor Reverend Stone, the village doctor-cum-missionary was the only source of anti-venom medicine that&rsquo;s close enough to the murder site to make a difference.  <br><br>
While the hospital had the medicine, by the time a victim got there, it would be too late.
&ldquo;Not the antidote!&rdquo; The good pastor&rsquo;s voice rang out.<br><br>
Stanley sprinted to the cottage. Someone left the door unlocked. The smell of antiseptic filled his nostrils.<br><br>
Glass crashed. Fists pounded. &ldquo;Kill him,&rdquo; a hoarse voice rasped.

He carried an impressive bouquet of flowers from some expensive shop, the name of the shop displayed with pride. Stanley used to give her wildflowers he picked. She still preferred Stanley.<br><br>
&ldquo;Give him a chance,&rdquo; Daddy winked as he left the room.<br><br>
They had seen each other during the formal introductions by the matchmaker. Both families liked each other. His family ran an inn in the city for travelers. That meant he was well off and could provide well for Eve and her future children.<br><br>
He was… nice. Though his fragrance choice was... overenthusiastic.<br><br>
&ldquo;Hello, Eve,&rdquo; he shook her hand. His limp grip felt like a cold dead fish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jeffrey. But you can call me Jeff.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Stanley grabbed Mary&rsquo;s arms as if they were his lifeline. She was Eve&rsquo;s best friend. His heart throbbed with a glimmer of hope – Mary can help.<br><br>
Mary&rsquo;s cheeks-tinged pink. She shook him off. &ldquo;Eve&rsquo;s daddy found that you&rsquo;re a fugitive. He forbids Eve from seeing you.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;But who&rsquo;s that guy?&rdquo; Stanley pointed at the window.<br><br>
&ldquo;Jeffrey. The son of the owner of the Traveler&rsquo;s inn. Eve&rsquo;s daddy wants her to marry him because he thinks Jeffrey would take good care of her,&rdquo; Mary bit her lip. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;

<blockquote> 
Bloodied bodies strewn the floor. Unmoving. The stench of nausea and poison, overwhelming.<br><br>
&ldquo;Are any of them alive?&rdquo; George felt the wrist of the nearest body, prompting his men to do the same. 
&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; came the reply.<br><br>
&ldquo;A massacre,&rdquo; Stanley&rsquo;s face was stoic, as if he had seen such violent deaths before. <br><br>
Eve on the other hand looked horrified. She was as pale as a ghost. Her lips trembled. &ldquo;What happened? Who killed them?&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Sanhehu,&rdquo; George replied. &ldquo;The Syndicate&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he turned to his men. &ldquo;Hunt them down.&rdquo;<br><br>
The men streamed out of the house as ordered. George crouched. His hand felt the neck of a corpse. It was still warm.<br><br>
&ldquo;Who are the Sanhehu?&rdquo; Eve&rsquo;s curiosity knows no end.<br><br>
&ldquo;An Indonesian Chinese Triad. They smuggle opium from China to process here for sale in Indonesia,&rdquo; George explained. &ldquo;Their leaders killed Major Whitaker&rsquo;s parents when he was young.&rdquo;
