        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Guillemard East Primary School</h1>
        <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Guillemard East Primary School was located behind Singapore Badminton Hall. Sadly, it closed in 1987 due to low enrollment.<br><br>
Memories of the old school are kept alive through the Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/guillemardeast/">Guillemard East Primary School</a>.<br><br>

That school held fond childhood memories for me. It&rsquo;s also where my father worked as a teacher. He&rsquo;d drop me off then head for his duties while I go for class. After school, we meet and I&rsquo;d follow him around. He took care of the library and coached the Badminton team after school. We&rsquo;d have lunch nearby. I vaguely remember enjoying the chicken rice in a coffee shop nearby.<br><br>
The school tuckshop had tasty food we can get for recess. I loved the mee there. <br><br>
It might be my imagination but the snacks from the snack shop were a lot tastier than the same snacks today. Jack and Jill potato chips, crispy noodle snacks and so much more were a huge treat then. They don&rsquo;t taste as good these days. <br><br>
I also remember cars parked under sprawling trees near the outdoor assembly area.<br><br>
We had amazing teachers there who cared for their students. It was a safe place for everyone then. The teachers and kindly principal Mr. Leong saw to it.<br><br>
I last met our teachers at my dad&rsquo;s funeral wake a decade ago. They showed up to send my dad off, joking that they only met at funerals of former colleagues, wondering whose would be next.  They were as warm, welcoming and jovial as ever. The close knit group of our old teachers were family. <br><br>
The lyrics of the school song as shared by friends and former schoolmates in the Guillemard East Primary School facebook group:<br><br>

Verse 1.<br>
In Lorong Twenty is our school, <br>
With our friends we work and play, <br>
Tis where we learn of true virtue, <br>
As we live from day to day.<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Guillemard East Primary School, <br>
We will always be alert, <br>
With discipline and with verve, <br>
Ready to serve, ready to serve.<br><br>

Verse 2<br>
Rugged and strong we aim to be,<br>
Disciplined and forward looking,<br>
Pioneers brave we dare to be,<br>
Champs in every field of learning. <br>

            <p class="text-gray-600">Fiction inspired by fragments of the Author's memories from decades ago.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">The sequel to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3ZV5CWZ?notRedirectToSDP=1&ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&storeType=ebooks">Naughty Little Nonya</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC9WWS6Z">Little Nonya Escapades</a>, is set in Guillemard East Primary school so that even though our old school is physically gone, its memories live on through this tale. </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
Tammy&rsquo;s Daddy in the story is inspired by my own Daddy, Mr. Wee. I thought of him as my father and teacher when I wrote this work of fiction. 
You can get it in Amazon and other bookshops for a touch of nostalgia through Tammy&rsquo;s tale.
