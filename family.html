He works hard and plays hard, often sweeping Tammy&rsquo;s mother off her feet in an impromptu dance. His passion for life is evident in his enthusiasm for sharing his knowledge about the natural world and his love for his favorite dish, Hokkien Mee. He is a pillar of strength and safety for Tammy.</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Little Tammy&rsquo;s voice whimpered over the gushing sound of water below.<br><br>
His heart leaped. &ldquo;Tammy!&rdquo;<br><br>
He stared at the wide-open door behind the broken bookcase. Tammy&rsquo;s in there.<br><br>
With a torch to light the way, Tom ran down the stairs. Water filled the basement, reaching his waist. <br><br>
&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; A hoarse little voice cried. Shining the light in that direction he found Tammy. The water reached her chin.<br><br>
&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; Her terrified eyes lit up. Her smile warmed his heart.<br><br>
He swept the fragile bundle into his arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now.&rdquo; He whispered into the quivering girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s got you.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look so pretty in this,&rdquo; Tammy slipped Dolly&rsquo;s arms into the sleeves of the dainty kebaya top.<br><br>
Dolly didn&rsquo;t wear the dress. The dress wore her. Tammy frowned. You could see the gears turning in her head.<br><br>
She ran out of the room and returned with a giant pair of scissors. Pixie hid her face behind her paw. This is ludicrous.<br><br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Dolly.&rdquo; With bated breath, she cut the sleeve, tailoring the kebaya to fit Dolly.

Ever eager to please, little Tammy clambered onto a stool to retrieve a silver pin with a rose from a big red jewellery box. Chest puffed up; she waved her prize at Grandma. <br><br>
&ldquo;Not that one. Bring me the butterfly pin.&rdquo; Grandma waved her hand. &ldquo;The other box.&rdquo;<br><br>
Grandma resembled a mystical fairy godmother from the pages of the books Tammy read to Pixie. She looked magical in her pretty kebayas and shiny jewellery. Did she have a magic wand in one of those boxes?

Time stood still as Mummy&rsquo;s face turned red. Her eyes looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets. Daddy looked like he was trying hard not to laugh.<br><br>
&ldquo;Daddy! Mummy!&rdquo; Tammy put on a brave front and forced a smile.<br><br>
&ldquo;What did you girls do?&rdquo; Arms laden with groceries, Mummy stepped into the house, slipped, and fell.<br><br>
Daddy dropped his bags and caught her. Groceries scattered, eggs broke, oranges rolled on the floor, turning white with powder.<br><br>
&ldquo;Surprise! We made Winter Wonderland,&rdquo; Casey piped up as she helped picked up the rolling fruit.<br><br>
Tammy tried to help too. She walked towards an errant apple, slipped, slid and crashed into Daddy who carried Mummy. The trio toppled over and knocked down the precious porcelain vase which smashed into hundreds of itty-bitty little pieces.<br><br>
&ldquo;Tammy! Casey!&rdquo; Mummy&rsquo;s voice went up an octave, closing the door behind her.

Pixie poked her head into the wardrobe. There was a turquoise dress she could wear. Her little human wouldn&rsquo;t have to cut it to fit her.<br><br>
&ldquo;Woof!&rdquo;<br><br>
Tail wagging, Pixie dropped her choice at Tammy&rsquo;s feet.<br><br>
&ldquo;Do you want to look pretty, girl?&rdquo; Tammy ran her fingers through Pixie&rsquo;s soft fur. <br><br>
&ldquo;Woof,&rdquo; her tongue hung out as she drooled over the kebaya. Oops.<br><br>

Crawling into her tent, she sat between Teddy and Dolly. &ldquo;This is our new house,&rdquo; she declared her chest swelling with pride as she flipped open her story book.<br><br>
Pictures of cowboys roasting marshmallows over the campfire fascinated Tammy.<br><br>
&ldquo;Koko has a big bag of marshmallows,&rdquo; she whispered to Teddy. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t miss a few. We can roast them over our own campfire.&rdquo;<br><br>
She imagined herself in the woods, in front of her tent, singing with Teddy and Dolly, roasting marshmallows in front of their very own campfire. That would be so much fun!<br><br>
For a campfire, she&rsquo;d need kindling. Sticks and leaves would do the trick, she smiled to herself
