Back when this story was set, Singapore was under the rule of the British Empire. Stanley's great grandfather was a merchant from China who had gone to Singapore for business and eventually settled there. Hence, Stanley's family are Straits Born Chinese.

            Legend has it that before Captain Hawkins' time, the previous crew of The Everingham discovered a hidden pirate treasure. The last surviving member of that crew left behind a map and clues for Captain Hawkins before his death. Intrigued by the mystery, Captain Hawkins had the map framed and turned it into a team-building activity for his crew. However, the map soon vanished, and eerie events began to unfold on the ship.
