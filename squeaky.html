            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Squeaky, a Common Squirrel, first found his home in a tree near a Satay stall frequented by Cassie, Tammy, and Ah Kong. Lured by the irresistible aroma of peanuts in the satay sauce, Squeaky would sneak down to enjoy the leftover peanut sauce whenever the chance presented itself.
</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Cassie's observant eyes soon noticed Squeaky's antics. One day, she purposefully left a packet of peanuts on the table just for him. The taste of these peanuts was so tantalizing that Squeaky wanted more, leading him to follow Cassie to a forest where she and her brothers set camp. Sensing the presence of more delicious nuts, Squeaky didn't hesitate to help himself when Cassie took them out of her pocket. Thus, their unlikely partnership was born.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Squeaky has since proven himself to be a formidable ally, helping Cassie find and apprehend troublemakers, and even saving her life with the assistance of his extensive tribe. Squeaky's family is immense, boasting twenty uncles on his mother's side, thirty on his father's side, and twenty-five siblings, along with a large extended family. This fun-loving bunch works and plays in close proximity, many of them residing in the forest. They live harmoniously with humans, with several members having "adopted" a human or two.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">In Squeaky's case, he adopted Cassie as his "pet human" and takes it upon himself to watch over her.</p>

<blockquote><br><br>
First stop, the coffee shop where the men were known to hang out. Cassie hid behind a nearby tree, observing in silence. <br><br>

&ldquo;Whistle whistle whistle,&rdquo; the sound came from a branch above her. Looking up, she saw her new friend, Squeaky, the Squirrel. 
<br><br>
&ldquo;Chirp chirp,&rdquo; he scampered onto her shoulder.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Chatter chatter, bark. Eek eek,&rdquo; he waved his paws, pointing dramatically at &ldquo;The Stinger&rdquo; Loh - the creepy man who had glared at her during the funeral wake. He was skeletal yet muscular, with a stud on his upper lip and a tattoo on his back, peeking through his cotton singlet.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Is that the killer?&rdquo; Cassie whispered. 
<br><br>
&ldquo;Chirp chirp chirp,&rdquo; the squirrel nodded in response, confirming her theory.
