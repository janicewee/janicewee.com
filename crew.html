            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Ah Cheng has recently moved to Singapore from China. He communicates with Stanley through broken English, a smattering of Malay, a few Hokkien words, and sign language. Their mutual interest in physical training and developing fighting techniques helps them forge a strong friendship. Read more about Ah Cheng <a href="ahcheng.html">here</a></p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;That can pay my mum&rsquo;s doctor,&rdquo; Ah Cheng&rsquo;s reply in broken Malay was heartbreaking.<br><br>
&ldquo;What happened to her?&rdquo; Stanley took the opportunity to steer the conversation away. He wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with all that talk about the bounty he knew was on his head.<br><br>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; Ah Cheng&rsquo;s eyes watered. Blinking back tears he sighed. &ldquo;Without surgery, she has seventeen months,&rdquo; he explained in Hokkien.

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Ahmad in Singapore's Runaway</h1>
<blockquote>Near The Everingham, he saw another goon talking to Ahmad, showing him a photo. It wouldn&rsquo;t take a genius to guess whose likeness was on it.<br><br>
Dread overtook him. He had to think fast. Get back on the ship without getting caught.
Hide in plain sight.<br><br>
Fellow seamen from docked ships were carrying crates up the ramp behind the pair.<br><br>
Calming his frazzled nerves, Stanley walked up to the largest crate and rested it on his shoulder. It obscured his face when he carried it up the ramp. Holding his breath, as silent as a cat, he strode past Ahmad and the goon. <br><br>
For the briefest of moments, Ahmad&rsquo;s eyes followed him. Then he continued talking to Stepmother&rsquo;s henchman.

<blockquote>&ldquo;Did you catch him?&rdquo; Gopal perked up. <br><br>
 &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Stanley shrugged. &ldquo;Ghost attack covered his escape.&rdquo;<br><br>
&ldquo;Ghost?&rdquo; Ah Cheng joined the pair, dipping his brush into the pot.<br><br>
Gopal translated what they shared to Hokkien  so that Ah Cheng could join in the conversation. <br><br>
Ah Cheng looked agitated when Gopal mentioned Arnott Merrit. His face lit up as if a light bulb had switched on.<br><br>
Gopal shook his head, replied in fluent Hokkien and glared at Ah Cheng. <br><br>
From what Stanley could see, daredevil Ah Cheng was hatching yet another hair brained scheme.<br><br>
&ldquo;Bro, you are pathetic,&rdquo; he punched Stanley&rsquo;s arm.<br><br>
&ldquo;What do you mean. You are Chinese. Baba Hokkien,&rdquo; Gopal tilted his head.<br><br>
&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Stanley was puzzled.<br><br>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t speak Hokkien. I, an Indian, must translate your language to English so you can follow our conversation,&rdquo; chortled Gopal.
