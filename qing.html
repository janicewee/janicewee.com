            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">In the heart of early 1900s Singapore, the Qingde Huiguan emerged as a bastion of hope amidst the opium crisis. Founded by the determined Ah Beng, this society is an embodiment of resilience and resolve against the destructive clutches of opium addiction.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Witnessing the catastrophic effects of opium on their friends and family, the members of Qingde Huiguan pledged to combat this societal menace. The pain of seeing loved ones succumb to addiction, families torn apart, and the very fabric of society fraying, ignited a spark of resistance. This resistance, fueled by shared anguish and the will to act, gave birth to the Qingde Huiguan.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">From their humble headquarters, Qingde Huiguan launched a relentless fight against the opium trade. They sought to educate the public about the perils of opium, provide support to those entrapped in addiction, and lobby for stricter regulations and enforcement against the opium trade.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">The murder of one of their own, Craig, sent shockwaves through the society. Determined to bring his killer to justice, they enlisted the help of the astute private detective George Wong. His investigation weaves a thrilling sub-plot within Janice Wee's captivating novel, "Two Worlds, One Love & A Serial Killer".</p>

<br><br>
<blockquote>Members of the anti-opium Chinese society, the Qingde Huiguan streamed past ornate stone lions. One by one, they took their seats in the large wooden mansion that was their headquarters. <br><br>Incense hung on the pillars. The smell of burning bamboo with traces of sandalwood filled the hall.<br><br>
Ah Beng, the society&rsquo;s chief took the stage. His voice resounded through the massive hall, mesmerizing the audience. He explained the destruction recreational use of opium had wreaked in Singapore&rsquo;s Chinese population. He finished his speech by outlining the measures the Qingde Huiguan had taken to battle that demon.<br><br>
&ldquo;You all know George. He risked his life for the information he will now present,&rdquo; Ah Beng invited George to take centerstage. <br><br>
&ldquo;I have found Craig&rsquo;s killers,&rdquo; George began.
