            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Eve Neo is an Indonesian Chinese Christian and the daughter of successful businessman <a href="neos.html">John Neo</a>. With her spunky and mischievous personality, Eve is a true "Daddy's girl." She is an expert tree climber and enjoys playing pranks, often teaming up with her fraternal twin brother, James.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">When Eve meets Stanley Tan in a market, she is instantly attracted to him. She admires tall, strong, and good-looking men like Stanley. After saving Stanley from a snake bite, the two fall in love as he recovers under her care. They quickly realize that they are soul mates, and Eve becomes very protective of Stanley, even attempting to save him from what she believes is a ghostly serial killer.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Friendship is important to Eve, and she finds a confidant in Mary. The two women spend a lot of time helping each other out in their respective households. Eve is a talented cook and easily makes friends, although she is often the subject of gossip. She remains blissfully unaware of such chatter unless it is blatantly brought to her attention.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">Fiesty and independent, Eve refuses to marry the wimpy, boring man her father chooses for her. She runs away to find Stanley when her family tries to keep them apart. Together with Stanley and George, she investigates a murder in her family and uncovers the rival opium syndicates connected to the serial killer.</p>

<blockquote>He&rsquo;d be her next victim now that she knows he&rsquo;s nosing around.<br><br>
Eve&rsquo;s heart dropped to her shoes. She had to act now!<br><br>
Salt repels the Kuntilanak. Thorny sticks are the go-to weapon against the man-killing female spirit.<br><br> The mirror shows its true nature. Eve was ready for the fight of her life.<br><br>
Looking through the branches, she had a clear view of the Belle-shaped Kuntilanak sitting beneath her. Eve emptied the bag of salt on that evil spirit&rsquo;s bobbing head.<br><br>
Head thrown back, roaring in anger, the Kuntilanak screamed, &ldquo;Come down now! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;
<br><br>
