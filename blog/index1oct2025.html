<br><br>

When I first wrote Little Nonya Escapades, I intended to write a fictional story, using my own childhood memories as an initial draft.<br><br>
I had an amazing childhood. Dad and Mum were both schoolteachers who spent a lot of quality time with me. When my parents were working, grandpa doted on me.<br><br>
When it was time to go to primary school, they enrolled me in Daddy's school. Every day for those 6 years, when I was in the car with Daddy, he was Daddy. When I got out of the car and was in school grounds, he was Mr Wee. I was proud of my &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; back then. I never knew until decades later, after he had passed on, that it hurt him. The other teachers&rsquo; kids called their parents &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mummy&rdquo; if they happened to meet. I was the only one who greeted my dad like any student would greet a teacher, with that respectful nod and impersonal greeting.<br><br>
As I wrote, I poured my memories of those six years into my manuscript. I could remember every detail as clearly as if it had happened yesterday. I shared the first draft, my raw memories with my sister, for feedback. I had changed all the names except Daddy's and Teacher Elizabeth. That was my first step in &ldquo;fictionalising&rdquo; my story.<br><br>
She advised me to keep it as is. Let it be my autobiography. <br><br>
I'm fifty-six now. All this happened almost fifty years ago. Some of these events were so outlandish, readers would assume these to be figments of my imagination, so I didn't bother to turn any of it into fiction. No one would know the difference anyway.... Unless they happened to be there all those decades ago. I changed the names of everyone in the story to protect all identities.<br><br>
I don't think that really worked. Mum read it and in spite of the name changes, she knew every character. She even pointed out that I had forgotten to include Uncle Lye Hoe in one of the scenes. Oops.<br><br>
I didn't change Teacher Elizabeth's name because for so many decades, I wondered what happened to her. After that scene I described in my book, she disappeared. I never saw her again. I hoped that somehow somewhere, she might pick up my book and read it, and know what I never had a chance to tell her.<br><br>
After I published <a href="https://www.janicewee.com/nonyaescapades.html"><b>Little Nonya Escapades</b></a>, I asked my mother about her. Teacher Elizabeth disappeared because she had joined OMF and had become a missionary in India. She had just retired and was finally back in Singapore after all these decades. I got her number from my mother. <br><br>
Teacher Elizabeth never answers calls from numbers she did not recognise, but when I called her, for some unknown reason, she answered my call. We met for lunch with my mum, and have been meeting up every once in a while. The best news? <br><br>
She's my Godma now.&#128525;

                        </p>
                        <p><em>September 8, 2025</em></p>
                        <p>A must-read for fans of Christian speculative fiction, Janice Wee's Dragon Unbound plunges readers into a vibrant narrative set during the Millennial Kingdom, where biblical prophecy unfolds amidst the everyday lives of mortals and immortals alike.
The story spans a thousand years, centering on the captivating journey of Billy Lionheart and Bluma, from childhood friends to patriarch and matriarch of a new nation. Their lives are intertwined with significant spiritual events, including the long-awaited release of Dragon (Satan) from his thousand-year prison, leading to widespread deception and spiritual warfare.
Janice effectively portrays the challenges of faith and family in this post-Tribulation world, as characters grapple with spiritual attacks, personal struggles, and the consequences of deception, even within their own households. The inclusion of direct biblical passages and theological explanations enriches the narrative, offering clear spiritual insights that resonate deeply with Christian readers.
While covering mature themes, the writing style is straightforward and accessible, ensuring that the complex overarching narrative remains easy to follow. This direct approach allows the story's powerful messages of God's sovereignty, redemption, and ultimate triumph over evil to shine through. The author, being a Straits Born Chinese from Singapore, brings a unique perspective to this epic tale, making it a compelling read.
If you're looking for an allegorical story that blends action, family drama, and profound spiritual themes, Dragon Unbound will not disappoint. It's a journey of faith, perseverance, and the unwavering love of God in the face of ultimate evil.</p>

                        <p>An entertaining and imaginative story. Fun to read with a gentle perspective on love and loss. Billy is an orphan who yearns to be reunited with his parents. His guardian is a lion who is his fierce protector despite the youngster's penchant for mischief. The tale maps their growing relationship and offers a little bit of a Narnia-like adventure for younger readers.</p>

                        <p><em>January 1, 2024</em></p>
                        <p>The book discusses disturbing applications of modern technology with Bible Prophecy. It is character-driven, seen through the eyes of the diverse cast as the transition from today’s setting into a world ruled by a global dictator, the Antichrist. This dictator goes by the moniker - Beast. The book is fast-paced; the twists and turns that keep you turning the pages. It transitions from modern-day to the dystopian rule of Beast into the Utopian millennial rule where immortals live alongside mortals in a peaceful world before the Dragon’s release. It’s an epic speculative science fiction novel that draws on prophetic events. I find the book highly entertaining, and I recommend it.</p>
